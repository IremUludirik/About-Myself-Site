    <h2> About Myself </h2>
    <p> I was born on 28.04.98 in Eskişehir. I graduated from Marmara University Environmental Engineering
        in 100% English and also from Anadolu University Open Education Faculty Web Design and Coding
        departments. During my education process, I developed myself in terms of research, self-motivation,
        entrepreneurship and acquiring different abilities. In line with my education and experience, I had the
        opportunity to work with different people, to take part in a team and to learn how to produce together.
        I have been involved in many interdisciplinary projects. It attaches great importance to learning new
        things and improving my skills, and for this purpose, I think that it is necessary to benefit from the
        teaching of human relations. I solve problems on various sites and participate in challenges. I would
        like to state that I am extremely self-sacrificing and enthusiastic about being effective and fast in
        business life, and that I want to take on the responsibility required by the position with curiosity and
        enthusiasm. I am aware that willing and careful work will definitely result in success.
